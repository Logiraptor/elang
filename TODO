Small goal
structure definition order should not matter

Medium goal
functional structure update (copy on write)

Big goal:
compound structure support (arrays / structs)

setup CI to run e2e tests

figure out code coverage report and link to CI

automatic reference counting gc

High quality error messages
    - outside of parsing. (General error marshalling module)
    - Continue after first error


linking c functions (on hold until more builtins exist for `extern` definitions)
    - print_int (builtin)
    - printf (externed)

additional built-ins:
    - arrays
    - lambdas
